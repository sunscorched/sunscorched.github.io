This is a note on recreational mathematics I did with friends in which we proved the following statement which arises naturally when studying (sun)flowers: Consider all Fibonacci-recurrence sequences seeded with values strictly smaller than the $n$th Fibonacci number $F_n$. The smallest integer which does not appear in any such sequence is $F_n^2$.
