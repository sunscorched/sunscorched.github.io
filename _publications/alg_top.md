All surfaces, up to homeomorphism, can be formed by gluing the edges
of a polygon. This process is generalized into the idea of a $(n, 2n)$-cell complex:
forming a space by attaching a $(2nâˆ’1)$-sphere into a wedge sum of n-spheres. In this paper, we classify oriented, $(n-1)$-connected, compact and closed $2n$-manifolds up to homotopy by treating them as $(n, 2n)$-cell complexes. To simplify the calculation,
we create a basis called the Hilton basis for the homotopy class of the attaching map
of the $(n, 2n)$-cell complex. At the end, we show that two attaching maps give the
same, up to homotopy, manifold if and only if their homotopy classes, when written
in a Hilton basis, differ only by a change-of-basis matrix that is in the image of a
certain map $\Phi$, which we define explicitly in the paper.
