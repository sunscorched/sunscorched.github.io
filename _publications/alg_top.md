In this paper, we classify oriented, $(n-1)$-connected, compact and closed $2n$-manifolds up
to homotopy by treating them as $(n, 2n)$-cell complexes. To simplify the calculation,
we create a basis called the Hilton basis for the homotopy class of the attaching map
of the $(n, 2n)$-cell complex. At the end, we show that two attaching maps give the
same, up to homotopy, manifold if and only if their homotopy classes, when written
in a Hilton basis, differ only by a change-of-basis matrix.
