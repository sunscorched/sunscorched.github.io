In this note, we determine the structure of the associative algebra generated by the differential operators
and $\bar{\mu},\bar{\partial},\partial,\mu$ that act on complex-valued differential forms of almost complex manifolds. 
This is done by showing that it is the universal enveloping algebra of the graded Lie algebra generated by these operators 
and determining the structure of the corresponding graded Lie algebra. We then determine the cohomology of this graded Lie 
algebra with respect to its canonical inner differential $[d,âˆ’]$, as well as its cohomology with respect to all its inner differentials.
