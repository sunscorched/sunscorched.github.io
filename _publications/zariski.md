We give a new proof of Zariski's multiplicity conjecture in the case of isolated hypersurface singularities; this was first proved by de Bobadilla-Pe≈Çka. Our proof uses the TQFT structure of fixed-point Floer cohomology and the fact that adjacent singularities produce symplectic cobordisms between the Milnor fibrations of the singularities. The key technical result is to construct a chain map on Floer cochains using the cobordism and as a last step, apply a spectral sequence of McLean. This last step allows us to also recover a theorem of Varchenko
