This is sort of a dumping ground for some of the expository math notes I've written over the years.

<h2>Geometry</h2>

 <p>Open a PDF file <a href="/files/paper1.pdf">example</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Note on the Poincar√©-Hopf theorem via Morse theory.</li>
<li>Note on the simplest example of the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem I know: d+d* and the Euler characteristic of genus-g Riemann surfaces.</li>
<li>Note on Atiyah's "New Invariants of 3- and 4-Dimensional Manifolds." The original paper is brilliant and outlines some relationships between Floer theory and gauge theory, topology and geometry. You really should read that first.</li>
<li>Note on Witten's "Supersymmetry and Morse Theory" paper.</li>
<li>Note from a talk on the Jones Polynomial, by Witten.</li>
<li>Note on Milnor fibrations and Picard-Lefschetz theory.</li>
<li>Very brief note on why virtual fundamental cycles appear in symplectic topology.</li>
<li>Very brief note on complex K3 surfaces.</li>
<li>Note from a talk on Heegaard Floer homology.</li>
<li>Note on 1st Chern class of CP^n and relative homotopy.</li>
<li>Note on basic contact geometry, Boothby-Wang bundles, Liouville domains, symplectic (co)homology, and wrapped Lagrangian Floer homology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Physics</h2>

Note on symplectic geometry and it's relationship to classical mechanics.
Note which compares classical and quantum mechanics from a rather mathematical viewpoint.
Note on my very basic impression of quantum field theory.
Note on classical field theory, based on my reading of notes by Charles Torre.
Notes from a talk on light rays and black holes by Witten: Part 1 and Part 2.

<h2>Random Notes</h2>

Notes from a first semester graduate course on real analysis I took. The examples for different modes of convergence are rather useful.
Finite fields: notes from an abstract algebra class I taught.
Irrationality of pi via Niven.
Short proof that the harmonic series diverges.
Some things I learned from the YouTube channel 3blue1brown.
