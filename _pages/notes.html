This is sort of a dumping ground for some of the expository math notes I've written over the years. Read at your own risk for there are likely to be mistakes.

<h2>Geometry</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="/files/Poincare_Hopf.pdf">Note</a> on the Poincaré-Hopf theorem via Morse theory.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/files/simple_index_theorem.pdf">Note</a> on the simplest example of the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem I know: $d+d^*$ and the Euler characteristic of genus-$g$ Riemann surfaces.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/files/Atiyah_low_dim_invariants.pdf">Note</a> Atiyah's "New Invariants of 3- and 4-Dimensional Manifolds." The original paper is brilliant and outlines some relationships between Floer theory and gauge theory, topology and geometry. You really should read that first.</p></li>
<li>Email me for a note on Witten's "Supersymmetry and Morse Theory" paper.</li>
<li>Note from a talk on the Jones Polynomial, by Witten.</li>
<li>Note on Milnor fibrations and Picard-Lefschetz theory.</li>
<li>Very brief note on why virtual fundamental cycles appear in symplectic topology.</li>
<li>Very brief note on complex K3 surfaces.</li>
<li>Note from a talk on Heegaard Floer homology.</li>
<li>Note on 1st Chern class of CP^n and relative homotopy.</li>
<li>Note on basic contact geometry, Boothby-Wang bundles, Liouville domains, symplectic (co)homology, and wrapped Lagrangian Floer homology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Physics</h2>

<ul>
<li>Note on symplectic geometry and it's relationship to classical mechanics.</li>
<li>Note which compares classical and quantum mechanics from a rather mathematical viewpoint.</li>
<li>Note on my very basic impression of quantum field theory.</li>
<li>Note on classical field theory, based on my reading of notes by Charles Torre.</li>
<li>Notes from a talk on light rays and black holes by Witten: Part 1 and Part 2.</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Random Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Notes from a first semester graduate course on real analysis I took. The examples for different modes of convergence are rather useful.</li>
<li>Finite fields: notes from an abstract algebra class I taught.</li>
<li>Irrationality of pi via Niven.</li>
<li>Short proof that the harmonic series diverges.</li>
<li>Some things I learned from the YouTube channel 3blue1brown.</li>
</ul>
