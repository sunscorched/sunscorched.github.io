Hi, my name is Sam Auyeung, a recent graduate from Stony Brook University. I will be a Harold L. Dorwart visiting assistant professor at Trinity College starting Fall 2023. My main research interest is in symplectic geometry and how it interacts with other fields of mathematics such as algebraic geometry. I also have some work on almost complex manifolds and algebraic topology.
