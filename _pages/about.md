Welcome! I am a recent PhD graduate from Stony Brook University and will be a Harold L. Dorwart visiting assistant professor at Trinity College starting Fall 2023. My main research interest is in symplectic geometry and how it interacts with other fields of mathematics such as algebraic geometry. I also have some work on almost complex manifolds and algebraic topology. I earned my BS in mathematics and BA in philosophy and Greek from Calvin College.
