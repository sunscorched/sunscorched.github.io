Welcome! I am a Harold L. Dorwart visiting assistant professor at [Trinity College](https://www.trincoll.edu/) where I put my passion for teaching mathematics and statistics into practice. Currently, I am very interested in machine learning and data science, specifically as it pertains to quantitative finance. I am passionate about applying my technical and quantitative skills in order to add value. Finance is particularly fascinating to me because, to quote Matt Levine, "Finance is a meta-layer on top of society that encodes, in some complicated and impossible-to-reconstruct way, the attitudes and structures of society."

Previously, my research interest was in [symplectic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry#) and how it interacts with other fields of mathematics such as algebraic geometry. I also have some work on almost complex manifolds, algebraic topology, and a generalized eigenvalue problem in applied math. I earned my BS in mathematics and BA in philosophy and Greek from [Calvin College](https://calvin.edu/academics/departments-programs/mathematics-statistics/academics/mathematics) and my PhD from [Stony Brook University](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/stony-brook-mathematics-department-and-institute-mathematical-sciences).
