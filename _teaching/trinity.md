I am a Harold L. Dorwart visiting assistant professor at [Trinity College](https://www.trincoll.edu/mathematics/). This semester, I am teaching multivariable and vector calculus where I make use of tools such as Geogebra. Here are some examples: [Frenet frame](https://www.geogebra.org/3d/qbc9v6xc), [twisted cubic](https://www.geogebra.org/3d/yvf4cya8), [level curves](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/v7cwcrisnb), [tangents to a surface](https://www.geogebra.org/3d/t7kgsrxg).
