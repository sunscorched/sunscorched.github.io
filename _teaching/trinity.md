I am a Harold L. Dorwart visiting assistant professor at [Trinity College](https://www.trincoll.edu/mathematics/). This Spring 2025, I am teaching an introductory statistics course and a differential equations course. In my teaching, I enjoy using free online tools such as Desmos and Geogebra. Here are some examples: 
* Statistics: [Type I and II Errors](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/06ljv6oxtu)
* Calculus I: [Secant and Tangent Lines](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/uhor2kqhki), [Implicit Differentiation](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qygf7xdkjc), [Newton Approximation](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/s8d8rgrrdx), [Quartics Know the Golden Ratio](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bzodfdyj5b)
* Multivariable and Cector Calculus: [Polar Coordinates](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fzqpsdy7or), [Frenet Frame](https://www.geogebra.org/3d/qbc9v6xc), [Twisted Cubic](https://www.geogebra.org/3d/yvf4cya8), [Level Curves](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/v7cwcrisnb), [Tangents to a Surface](https://www.geogebra.org/3d/t7kgsrxg), [Lagrange Multipliers](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/q2ciblaguj)
* Differential equations: [Resonance in Undamped Harmonic Oscillators with Sinusoidal Forcing](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/u9qrxmhhlr), [Bifurcation Diagram](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qlcogpj21k)
