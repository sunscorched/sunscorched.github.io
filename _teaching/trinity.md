I am a Harold L. Dorwart visiting assistant professor at [Trinity College](https://www.trincoll.edu/mathematics/). This Spring 2025, I am teaching an introductory statistics course and a differential equations course. In my teaching, I enjoy using tools such as Desmos. Here are some examples: 
* Differential equations: [Resonance in undamped harmonic oscillators with sinusoidal forcing](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/u9qrxmhhlr)
* Calculus I: [Implicit Differentiation](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qygf7xdkjc)
* Multivariable and vector calculus: [Frenet frame](https://www.geogebra.org/3d/qbc9v6xc), [twisted cubic](https://www.geogebra.org/3d/yvf4cya8), [level curves](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/v7cwcrisnb), [tangents to a surface](https://www.geogebra.org/3d/t7kgsrxg).
