Consider a simple swinging pendulum. One way to describe its physical state is to use an angle to describe its position with respect to the vertical (where it is located when at rest) and to also give a number describing its angular velocity. The space of all configurations, also called a **phase space**, is $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}$ since the circle $S^1$ describes the angles and the real numbers describe the angular velocity.
