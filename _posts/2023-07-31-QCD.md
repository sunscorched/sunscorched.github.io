Yesterday, I attended the last [summer Sunday](https://www.bnl.gov/sundays/fascinating-physics.php) at Brookhaven National Labs and in particular, did a brief tour of the engineering department that worked on building the RHIC (relativistic hadron ion collider) as well as hear a lecture by [Gene van Buren](https://tbrnewsmedia.com/knowledge-for-the-sake-of-knowledge-gene-van-buren/) on a solenoidal tracker attached to RHIC called the [STAR detector](https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/star.php). The RHIC is able to accelerate gold nuclei to 99.995% the speed of light; the track has about a 2.5 mile circumference and the particles travel around it about 80,000 per second. At speeds like this, the particles are very massive and experience very little time. This statement is not something we usually say in our everyday experiences but if you have some experience with special relativity, you know that in order to accelerate something, you need to apply force. At speeds near the speed of light, there is a diminishing return. In order to gain a fraction of speed, one needs to apply more and more force and asymptotically, one needs an infinite amount of force to get to the speed of light. If we view mass as a property which resists being moved (faster), then one way to view relativistic particles is that they're very massive; cf. moment of intertia.

Now, what is it that nuclear physicists like Gene want to understand? There's t

We have representation theory to describe but not explain quark confinement.

Quantum-gluon soup is liquid and has the lowest possible viscosity! Also, has pressure!
