In this post, I'll like to provide two proofs of the Pythagorean theorem which I find elegant and also, don't really require anything other than pictures though, of course, I'll discuss them with words as well. But before that, I'll share a bit of personal history.

It sometimes surprises people to know that I never took a geometry class in high school (or middle school) despite the fact I'm now a geometer. Somehow, it was arranged that I'd skip geometry and algebra I between middle school and high school and take algebra II in 9th grade. I went to public schools where this seemed really common. In fact, many of my classmates skipped precalculus as well after doing some self-study in the summer. At the end of freshman year, I had a B+ in algebra II so I figured I wasn't that good at math. The next three years, I did not particularly enjoy math; that changed slightly in 12th grade but only marginally. In fact, senior year, I told my classmates that I was interested in majoring in engineering in college and then said, "But I really don't like math." They warned me that engineering would require me to do a lot of math, similar to high school. Good thing I didn't major in engineering; I would not have enjoyed doing math like in high school!

Now, recall that if we have a right triangle in the Euclidean plane with side lengths $a,b,c$ where $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side), the Pythagoreans understood that the three numbers are related to each other by the equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

### First Proof

I was told that this proof was known to the ancient Chinese. I've labeled the side lengths but the picture could have gone without them. See if you can understand why $a^2+b^2=c^2$ before going ahead for an explanation.

The left image is of a square with side lengths $a+b$ and so we can fit in a square of side length $a$ and a square of side length $b$ into it, as depicted. There is then some left over area which I've divided into four triangles. These triangles are copies of the right triangle mentioned above. In the right image, we have the same large square of side length $a+b$. Inside of this large square, we again have our right triangle and we put a square of side length $c$ inside. What we find is that if we remove this square, we're left with four right triangles, again copies of the right triangle from before. They're arranged differently than in the left hand image but they have the same area. So then, in both images, the largest squares have the same area and if we remove the four triangles in each image, we must be left with the same area. One representation of the area is as the sum of the areas of two squares of side lengths $a$ and $b$ (left side) and another representation is as the area of one square of side length $c$ (right side).

I like a proof without lots of symbols. Though I didn't take high school geometry, I've tutored the subject and I find it rather confusing or at least dry to start with axioms and build up a bunch of lemmas and propositions using two-column proof styles. There's nothing wrong with doing geometry in this manner but I suspect that Euclid wrote _The Elements_ to be academically rigorous; he probably didn't imagine 14 year old students learning geometry in the style of his writing.

### Second Proof

I learned this proof from Roger Penrose's _The Road to Reality_ though I don't know if this proof originates with him; I doubt it, only because the Pythagorean Theorem has been known for millenia. Let's begin with a question. **Given two squares, can we use copies of them to tile the plane?** We must use them
