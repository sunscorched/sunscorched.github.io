Another topic I've introduced in my differential equations class regards nonlinear systems. Let's consider just systems of two equations of the following form:

$$\begin{cases}
x'(t) = f(x,y) \\
y'(t) = g(x,y)
\end{cases}$$

Since $f,g$ can be any kinds of functions, they can be, in particular, nonlinear. However, one of the lessons of differential calculus is that we may, as a first pass, approximate behavior by linearizing. For example, the 1st derivative of a single-variable differentiable function is used to define a tangent line which, locally, is hopefully a good approximation of the function.

So we'll do our analysis in two stages. First, we will find the **nullclines** for this system and then linearize at the **equilibrium points.**

The **$x$-nullclines** are the points in the $xy$-plane such that $f(x,y) = 0$. At these points, $x'(t) = 0$ and hence, the vector field described by the system of equations is pointing vertically (or is 0). Similarly, the **$y$-nullclines** are the points where $g(x,y) = 0$. At these points, the vector field is pointing horizontally (or is 0). The intersection of these two sets then gives all the points where the vector field is 0; i.e. the equilibria.

One may use the nullclines to partition the $xy$-plane into pieces and then study the qualitative behavior of solutions. For example, let's have $f(x,y) = y-x$ and $g(x,y) = \cos(x)$. Then the $x$-nullclines form the diagonal line $y=x$ and the $y$-nullclines form a series of vertical lines $x = n \pi/2$ where $n$ is an odd integer since $\cos(n \pi/2) = 0$ in those cases. Now, if we plot out the phase portrait for this system using, for example, the excellent free [applet](https://aeb019.hosted.uark.edu/pplane.html), we'll find the following:

Here, I've picked some solutions for the applet to plot; we can see that there are two general behaviors occurring. We have spiraling behavior at some equilibrium points, namely those for $n \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ and what look like saddle points when $n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. We may explain this behavior by now doing our second step: **linearization at the equilibria.**

The first equation above is linear already but the second one is not. However, we know that the Taylor series of a smooth function $f(x)$ at a point $a$ is $\sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k$. For cosine, the first two terms when centered at $a$ is $\cos(a)−\sin(a)(x−a)$. When $a$ is one of the equilibrium points, the first term vanishes. If $n \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, then
we have $-(x - n\pi/2)$. If $n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, then it is $+(x - n\pi/2)$. So the linear systems we get have matrices:
$$\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 1 \\
-1 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}$$

The first has eigenvalues $(-1\pm i\sqrt{3})/2$ and the latter has $(-1 \pm \sqrt{5})/2$. Thus, in the first case, we have complex eigenvalues; the negative real part means we have **spiral sources.** For the other case, since $\sqrt{5}>1$, we have a pair of eigenvalues of opposite parity and thus, get **saddle points.**

### Another Example: 1-Paramater Family of Nonlinear Systems

Let's take another example

$$\begin{cases}
x'(t) = −x + x^3 + y \\
y'(t) = -\mu x + y, \mu \in \mathbb{R}
\end{cases}$$

The $x$-nullclines lie on the curve $y = x -x^3$ and the $y$-nullclines on $y = \mu x$. The equilibria come from the intersections of the nullcline sets. Setting $\mu x = x -x^3$, we rearrange to get $x^3 + (\mu - 1)x = 0$. This has 3 solutions when $\mu < 1$, giving us 3 equilibria, and only 1 solution when $\mu > 1$. When $\mu > 1$, the only equilibria is $(0, 0)$. When $\mu < 1$, the equilibria are
$(0, 0),(\sqrt{1 -\mu}, \mu\sqrt{1 -\mu}),(-\sqrt{1 -\mu},-\mu\sqrt{1 -\mu})$.

Philosophy: vector field described by just spatial positions but out of it, we get time-dependent solutions.
