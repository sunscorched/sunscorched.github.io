Another topic I've introduced in my differential equations class regards nonlinear systems. Let's consider just systems of two equations of the following form:

$$\begin{cases}
x'(t) = f(x,y) \\
y'(t) = g(x,y)
\end{cases}$$

Since $f,g$ can be any kinds of functions, they can be, in particular, nonlinear. However, one of the lessons of differential calculus is that we may, as a first pass, approximate behavior by linearizing. For example, the 1st derivative of a single-variable differentiable function is used to define a tangent line which, locally, is hopefully a good approximation of the function.

So we'll do our analysis in two stages. First, we will find the **nullclines** for this system and then linearize at the **equilibrium points.**

The **$x$-nullclines** are the points in the $xy$-plane such that $f(x,y) = 0$. At these points, $x'(t) = 0$ and hence, the vector field described by the system of equations is pointing vertically (or is 0). Similarly, the **$y$-nullclines** are the points where $g(x,y) = 0$. At these points, the vector field is pointing horizontally (or is 0). The intersection of these two sets then gives all the points where the vector field is 0; i.e. the equilibria.

One may use the nullclines to partition the $xy$-plane into pieces and then study the qualitative behavior of solutions. For example, let's have $f(x,y) = y-x$ and $g(x,y) = \cos(x)$. Then the $x$-nullclines form the diagonal line $y=x$ and the $y$-nullclines form a series of vertical lines $x = n \pi/2$ where $n$ is an odd integer since $\cos(n \pi/2) = 0$ in those cases. Now, if we plot out the phase portrait for this system using, for example, the excellent free [applet](https://aeb019.hosted.uark.edu/pplane.html), we'll find the following:

Philosophy: vector field described by just spatial positions but out of it, we get time-dependent solutions.
