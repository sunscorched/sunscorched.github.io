I'm teaching Calculus 1 this semester and one of my former students introduced me to the following problem.

**Problem:** Let $f(x)$ be a cubic polynomial where the deg 3 term is $x^3$; that is, the leading coefficient is $+1$. Let $s(x) = \sin^2(\pi x)$ and $g(x) = f(s(x))$. Suppose know the following:
1. The function $g$ has exactly 3 local maxima in the interval $[0,1]$ and they all have the same value.
2. The maximum of $g$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ and the minimum is $0$.
Find the $f$.
