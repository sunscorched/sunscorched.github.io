I recently learned of a fun "application" of topology. A gimbal is a tool built from three nested rings, meant to model rotations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and also used by older systems for navigation and orientation. Let $SO(3)$ denote the Lie group of $3\times 3$ real matrices with $\det = +1$; these give rotations on $\mathbb{R}^3$ and together, they form a space which one can identify as being diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{RP}^3$, real projective space.

However, we see that there's an issue with the gimbal as a model for rotations. We have 3 degrees of freedom most of the time but if all three rings lie in the same plane, then they cannot rotate on the axis perpendicular to that plane; so you lose a degree of freedom. This is called **gimbal locking.** Now, I'm not sure if this is historically accurate or just was in the movie but supposedly, in the Apollo 13 space mission, their spacecraft became unstable because their navigation computer (specifically the inertial measurement unit) got into a gimbal lock. That wasn't their biggest problem but was one of them.

Anyways, another way to know that gimbal locking must happen is that the three rings rotating can be modeled by the 3-torus $T^3$ (just three copies of a circle, each circle representing the angle of rotation of one of the rings). In fact, we can see that any model based on using three angles will also fail, even if we made something more elaborate than a gimbal. Here's the topology statement: 

**Lemma:** There does not exist a covering map $T^3 \to SO(3)$; in particular, there can't be a map that is a local diffeomorphism at every point. This means there is at least some point where the rank of the map is less than 3, a loss of at least one degree of freedom.

**Proof:** The space $\mathbb{RP}^3 = SO(3)$ is double covered by the 3-sphere $S^3$ and $\pi_4(S^3) = \mathbb{Z}/2$. In fact, it's generated by the suspension of the Hopf fibration $\eta:S^3 \to S^2$ and becomes stable under suspension starting here. Since covering maps induce isomorphisms on all higher homotopy groups, $\pi_4(SO(3)) = \mathbb{Z}/2$ as well. But $\pi_i(T^3) = 0$ for $i>1$. Hence, any map $T^3 \to SO(3)$ will always fail to be a covering. $\square$
