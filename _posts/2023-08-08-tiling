In this post, I'll like to provide two proofs of the Pythagorean theorem which I find elegant and also, don't really require anything other than pictures though, of course, I'll discuss them with words as well. It sometimes surprises people to know that I never took a (Euclidean) geometry class prior to college despite the fact I'm a geometer now. Somehow, I was told that I'd skip geometry and algebra I between middle school and high school and take algebra II in 9th grade (I went to public schools). At the end of the year, I had a B+ in algebra II and did not particularly enjoy math. In fact, senior year, I told my classmates that I was interested in majoring in engineering in college and then said, "But I really don't like math." They warned me that engineering would require me to do a lot of math, similar to high school. Good thing I didn't major in engineering! I would not have enjoyed doing math like in high school!
