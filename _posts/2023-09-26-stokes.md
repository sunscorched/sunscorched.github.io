In a class on vector calculus, the students are presented with a few theorems such as the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, Green's Theorem, Stokes' Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem. The first one relates differentiation and integration in the following way. Take the gradient of a multivariable function $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ and consider a smooth path parametrized by $\vec{r}(t)$ with $t\in [a,b]$. Then the definite integral of the dot product $\nabla f \cdot d\vec{r} \, dt$, a quantity arising from a 1-dimensional object has a 0-dim interpretation: $\int^a\_b \nabla f \cdot d \vec{r}\,dt = f(\vec{r}(b)) - f(\vec{r}(a))$.
