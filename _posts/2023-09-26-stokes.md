In a class on vector calculus, the students are presented with a few theorems such as the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, Green's Theorem, Stokes' Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem. The first one relates differentiation and integration in the following way. Take the gradient of a multivariable function $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ and consider a smooth path parametrized by $\vec{r}(t)$ with $t\in [a,b]$. Then the definite integral of the dot product $\nabla f \cdot d\vec{r} \, dt$, a quantity arising from a 1-dimensional object has a 0-dim interpretation: $\int^a\_b \nabla f \cdot d \vec{r}\,dt = f(\vec{r}(b)) - f(\vec{r}(a))$. The proof of this really is just to use the usual Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

Green's theorem is a statement about an integral over some compact 2-dim region with boundary and relating that to an integral along the boundary. More precisely, let $R$ be the region and suppose is has smooth boundary which is a (possible disconnected) simple curve with positive orientation. Let $P,Q:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ be once-differentiable functions. Then: $\oint_{\partial R}(P dx+Q dy)=\iint_{R}\left({\frac {\partial Q}{\partial x}}-{\frac {\partial P}{\partial y}}\right)dx\,dy$.
