I'm teaching Multivariable and Vector Calculus at Trinity College this fall semester and have students with all kinds of backgrounds. For some of them, this is their first semester of college and are used to year-long math classes rather than a whole course in one semester. The calculus they had was high-school AP Calculus which is at a different level than college-level calculus and can vary a lot depending on, say, whether it's a public high school or a private science and technology magnet school. Some of them finished high school on Zoom because of COVID and for many, distance learning is not as effective as in-person learning. Some of them don't speak English as their first language. For others, they've taken the first two college-level calculus courses and have also taken Physics: Mechanics and Physics: Electromagnetism where vector calculus already appears. So this class is a breeze for them. One of my students went the first three months of his first year before losing a single point in any of his classes. English is not his first language and so he seems to appreciate that in a math course, the most important language to understand is mathematics (though of course that happens by means of English in my classroom).

There's certainly ways to help students of different backgrounds and there are a lot of external resources online, in textbooks, in the form of tutors, study groups, flashcards, my office hours, etc. But I think that many of these external "fixes" don't address the root issue. I think the root issue is that students don't actually know what mathematics is about. They don't know the mathematician's view: that math is primarily about human understanding of structure and using powerful abstraction to get to the essence of an idea or to broaden the scope of what true statements can be said. Instead, what they know is what, say, high school math class is about: do homework, take exams, try to get a good grade. But these are almost two separate worlds. It's similar to the difference between reading _Hamlet_ and being able to name some characters and describe a basic plot versus being to write your own play that reaches the same acclaim as _Hamlet_ (whether you like his plays, I think it's undeniable that Shakespeare has made a lasting name for himself).

Well, of course it's too much to ask for students to jump right into doing mathematics like a mathematician just as it would be unreasonable to expect someone who read Shakespeare to then be able to write like Shakespeare. But one can't always stay at the high school view of math. Here's an extended culinary analogy.

High school and intro college math: You are tasked with preparing a microwave meal. You read the instructions, peel the plastic film off halfway and microwave the food for 2 minutes, let it rest for 1, and then microwave it again for 2 minutes. You take it out cautiously and put the food in a serving dish.

Intermediate to advanced college math: You are given ingredients and a recipe that isn't the most thorough


Graduate school dissertation: find your own ingredients at the store, need to select what is fresh and suitable, very vague recipe
Math research: you may need to grow your own ingredients and there is no recipe
