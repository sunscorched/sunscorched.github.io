This is a somewhat different post from my previous ones about applying topology. However, the spirit of those posts was to illustrate unexpected applications and this post will remain in this spirit, if only because we'll be doing things in a backwards and needlessly complicated way which perhaps breaks expectations. Here is a question: given the ellipse $(ax+by)^2+(cd+dy)^2 = r^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, what are the lines which contain its major and minor axes?

If we write $H(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}(ax+by)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(cx+dy)^2$, then we can form a Hamiltonian system

$$\begin{cases}
\frac{dx}{dt} = \partial_y H  = b(ax+by) + d(cx+dy)\\
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\partial_x H = -a(ax+by) - c(cx+dy)
\end{cases}$$
