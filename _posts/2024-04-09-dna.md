In my freshmen year of college, some friends and I were too tired to do homework after dinner but too awake to go to bed. So we began cutting up strips of paper and then taping them to gether with various twists and seeing what would happen when we cut these up again. The most well-known of these creations is a cylinder where you simply take a long rectangular strip of paper and tape the two ends together without any flourish. But the second-most well known is the Möbius band which is made from taking a long rectangular strip of paper, making half a twist in the strip, and then taping the two ends together. If you then cut the cylinder by following the midline of the strip, you'll get an unsurprising result: you cut it into two cylinders. However, what happens if you cut the Möbius band in a similar way down the midline? If you've never done this before and want to give it a try, pause here and don't read on. I'll put a picture of the Lofoten Islands in Norway here for you to enjoy while you do some "experimental mathematics."

If you did things correctly, you should have found that the Möbius band, when cut that way, does not give you two pieces but one! Moreover, somehow, there are many twists in it. If you count carefully, you'll find four half-twists. There is a Numberphile [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKV0GYvR2X8) featuring [Tadashi Tokieda](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tadashi-tokieda-collects-math-and-physics-surprises-20181127/) who demonstrates some of these and gives an explanation for what's going on. There's also a follow-up [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh3eMt09EAs) where he continues the exploration.

I learned this idea from a biologist at CUNY who spoke at Jim Simons' 85th birthday math/physics celebration. There is also a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKV0GYvR2X8) of Tadashi Tokieda demonstrating the cutting of the cylinder and Möbius band. There is a part 2 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh3eMt09EAs) where he glues two cylinders/Möbius bands together and cuts both down the middle.

Anyways, primitive bacteria have DNA strands that form loops rather than strands since it's easier, instruction wise, to not have ends. If you have ends, you need to distinguish things on the interior and things on the boundary.

For biochemical reasons (according to the biologist), the DNA is twisted with an even number of half-twists. This means that it is orientable and so when cut down the middle, it will separate into two halves. Let $n$ be the number of half-twists. So $n \equiv 0\pmod{2}$. If $n=0$, then the two halves separate. But if $n \geq 2$, the two halves are interlinked.

So when does DNA get cut down the middle? During DNA replication, (which also occurs in plants and animals), the strand is essentially cut in half (or unzipped). Then, each half is replicated and new strands are formed by the DNA polymerase. The fact that you have this interlocking of the new "half" strands means that the DNA doesn't float too far away. Then the DNA polymerase can perform replication more easily without having to search far and wide for the different pieces. From an evolutionary biology perspective, this increases the chances for life to form since keeping the strands nearby is helpful.
